# Brew Buddy CLI App
#### Mod One Final Project

### Overview

Brew Buddy is a CLI App that accesses the BreweryDB API. It allows you search beers on the API, rate beers between 1-5, save beers that a user is interested, view profile stats, and view stats on the application as a whole. It relies on 4 Models to save data and create relationships and a Session Model to facilitate the user interaction with our menu interface. 

### Install Instructions

2. Open the terminal from the project root and run ```ruby bin/run.rb```
