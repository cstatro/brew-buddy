# Brew Buddy CLI App

#### Mod One Final Project

### Overview

Brew Buddy is a CLI app that utilizes the BreweryDB API. It allows you search beers populated from the API, rate beers on a scale between 1-5, save beers that a user is interested in, view profile stats, and view stats on the application as a whole. It relies on 4 models for saving/joining data and a session model to facilitate the user interaction with our menu interface.

### Install Instructions

1. Clone the project into a local repository and run `bundle install`
2. Open the terminal from the project root and run `ruby bin/run.rb`
